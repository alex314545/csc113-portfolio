#### Week 2: AI Tools & First Collaborations
**Date**: 1/27/2026

**What I learned this week:**
- There are different domains that specific AI excel in
- Prompt engineering is extremely helpful and creates one's own personal assistant
- Although rate limits are annoying sometimes, they offer protection and server fairness

**What challenged me:**
- Setting up the issue, branch, and the folder structure

**What I'm proud of:**
- Analyzed different AI models to figure out what best fit me and my goals

**Questions I still have:**
- What differs in the code from a general chatbot such as ChatGpt and a specific AI for problem-solving such as Claude?
