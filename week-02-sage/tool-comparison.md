## Comparative Analysis
All the Ai tools gave excellent, in-depth answers to the questions and are great resources to use for all the tasks. However, I noticed Gemini taking longer than the other two to give answers, possibly due to it finding resources with Google search and listing them. For the simple explanation, all AI gave great answers, with some giving examples and in what things AI is utilized in. For creative task, I thought they all performed very similarly again, but I liked Claude’s haiku the most. It sounded the most-human like and the most relatable. For information retrieval, I definitely prefer Google Gemini. It gives in-depth answers as well as where the AI found the information while linking me to the sources. For problem-solving, I would definitely prefer Claude. It gave a much more streamlined plan and accelerated the process a lot more, letting me learn more in those thirty days. While ChatGPT only had me making a commit on the seventh day and Gemini on the seventeenth, Claude had me already making four, providing much more experience in a shorter amount of time.
  Gemini is great for research. It provides significant information while including sources and hyperlinks for quick navigation to the websites. ChatGPT is more of an all-rounder. While it performs decent at all the tasks, it doesn’t excel in one area. One advantage ChatGPT holds over the others is the amount of users. This allows ChatGPT to access more data than the other AIs. Claude was the best at problem-solving and logic. It gave me a great, efficient plan for me to follow that was better than the others in my opinion. I also appreciate the haiku, in which the other AI made it sound much more “machine-like.”


## My Choice for Primary Tool
**Tool**: Claude 
**Reasoning**: Much more human-like and my main focus is coding
**Backup Plan**: Gemini
