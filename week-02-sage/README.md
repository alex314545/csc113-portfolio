# SAGE: My Study Assistant & Guide Engine

## What is SAGE?
SAGE is a personal companion to help me stay on track of my workload while adapting to my learning style

## How I'll Use SAGE This Semester
[List 3-5 specific ways you plan to use AI tools to help with your studies]
- Explain hard-to-understand assignments or text
- Asking "why" if I don't understand the answer
- Creating study notes or mock tests
  
## Tools I'm Using
- **Primary**: Claude - I will mainly be asking help on logic and coding problems, the field in which Claude excels in
- **Secondary**: Gemini - Gives in-depth explanations, integrated with Google, and provides sources for all answers

## Ground Rules for Working with AI
- Use AI as learning tool
- Verifying all information
- Understanding rather than just copy-pasting
